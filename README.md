# 🌸 Iris Flower Classification (CodeAlpha Internship)

This project is part of the CodeAlpha Data Science Internship. The goal is to build a machine learning model to classify Iris flowers into Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica species based on their sepal and petal dimensions.

---

## 🔍 Objective

To apply data preprocessing, visualization, and machine learning techniques to the classic Iris dataset using Python and Scikit-learn.
